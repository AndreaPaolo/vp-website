      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Valentina! I was born in the shadow of Brunelleschi&amp;rsquo;s dome, Florence, but my heart has always been constantly facing south (mainly facing sourthern Italy).
I talk a lot but not with everyone, I get excited in front of simple things and sunsets and I believe that love is the engine of (my) life.
My first trip was when I was two years old and I think that this passion was born in that moment or, perhaps, it was already written somewhere.</description>
