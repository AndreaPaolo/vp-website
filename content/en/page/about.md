Hi, I'm Valentina!
I was born in the shadow of **Brunelleschi's dome**, Florence, but my heart has always been constantly facing south (mainly facing sourthern Italy).

**I talk a lot** but not with everyone, **I get excited** in front of simple things and sunsets and I believe that **love** is the engine of (my) life.

**My first trip** was when I was two years old and I think that this passion was born in that moment or, perhaps, it was already written somewhere.
I left a piece of my heart in every place I visited but **there are two places I consider home**: **Gargano** (Apulia, south Italy) and **Sharm El Sheikh** (Egypt).

I'm deeply in love and somehow connected with the **sea** and **it's from here that Maruflmood is born**: [marufələ] means "**waves of sea**" in the dialect of an Apulian city (Apricena), and it's from Apricena that my love for Gargano is born.

I have a lot of hobbies but the constant, even in my studies, has always been **traveling joined with this desire to dive into different places and cultures**.

**I dream of becoming a digital nomad**, and losing myself in colors, sounds and fragrances of the world; get lost to find myself.

**I dream not to miss** any sunset sea view and to share all this with someone.

**I dream of showing you** through my eyes the places I visit and sharing tips with you to make you live the places I lived.

**I dream of collaborating with brands** that want to talk about themselves online and the find a way to do it through my eyes and my words.
