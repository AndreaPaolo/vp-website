The **Red Sea** is one of **the most popular destination** when we talk about **snorkeling** and **diving** and in Marsa Alam you can certainly enjoy a true underwater paradise.

If you're thinking of organizing a **trip to Marsa Alam** and you're asking you **which are the beaches that you absolutely must not miss**, you're in the right place.

You must know that most of the Resorts overlook the sea and have their own private beach, but knowing in which Resort stay or which excursion do, can make your holiday even more special.

#### **MARSA MUBARAK**

**Marsa Mubarak** beach is also called as "**Turtle Bay**" and this name isn't accidental. It's a **sandy beach** with an equally sandy bottom that slopes very gently. This beach **isn't equipped** and **not even very busy** (tourists usually arrive with boats tha stop offshore).

It would be a common beach were it not for the fact that, **already at little depth**, the first **turtles** can be found, while, where the water becomes higher, it will be possible to swim  together with biggest turtles. 

That's not all: **dugong** (or sea cow) can also be found here!

**Tip**: Marsa Mubarak is located about ten minutes walk from the "**Three Corners Fayrouz Resort**" (you must walk among the dunes and keep the sea alway on your left side). 

#### **ABU DABBAB**

**Abu Dabbab** beach is one of **the most popular**.
It's a **sandy beach** where **water is not so deep** (the maximum depth is about 20 meters) and **sheltered from the currents**; these features make it a very simple site and an excellent place for families with children and for those who are new to the world of diving. It's an **equipped beach** and **the entrance is subject to a payment**.

Here you can admire the **beauty of the corals** and swim surrounded by colorful fishes, just as if we were in an aquarium! Also here you can find turtles!

**Tip**: if you want to wnjoy this beach every day of your holiday, I recommend you to book at the "**Malikia Resort Abu Dabbab**" which is located right here.

#### **ABU DABOUR**

Perhaps **it's a bay not too well known** but that can leave you speechless for its beauty. 
It's a **simple site** for those who are new to the world of diving, although **currents can often be found**. 

Here you can admiring the beauty of the corals and swimming surrounded by fishes but you can also find **a lot of moray eel**, **turtles** and **dolphins**!

That's not all: if you choose to **dive north** you will have the chance to find bigger fishes (I even saw a shark!), while if you choose to **dive south** there are more beautiful corals and you will have the chance to **enter into a canyon**.

Near the bay it's possible to find two very particular beaches.

**Tip**: the "**Concorde Moreen Beach Resort & Spa**" overlooks this bay.

#### **SHARM EL LULI**

**Sharm El Luli** is also known as "**the Caribbean of Egypt**"; I think this is enought to make you understand the beauty.

It has been declared as **one of the most beautiful beaches in the world**. It's a **non equipped and unspoiled beach**, characterized by white sand contrasted by shades of blue of the sea.
If you're lucky, you can swim with the ****Hawksbill sea turtle****.

**Tip**: this beach is located about ten kilometers from the "**Gorgonia Beach Resort**".

#### **DOLPHIN HOUSE**

The real name of this bay is "**Sha'ab Samadai**" but it's known by all as "**Dolphin House**" becaue dolphins live here.

Since 2004 it has become a **National Park** thanks to the collaboration between the Italian cooperative and the Egyptian government.

The **reef has the shape of a horseshoe** and the bay is divided into three areas: an **exclusive area for dolphins**, one for **snorkelers** and the last one for **scuba divers**.

**Tip**: the "**Royal Brayka Bay Beach Resort**" is located very close to this bay.

#### WHITE ISLANDS

The **white islands of Hamata** are called in this way because of their white sand but are also known as "**the Maldives of Egypt**".
They are part of **Wadi El Gemal National Park** and they're **completely uninhabited** and reachable only by boat.

White sand contrasted by the blue of the sea, calm waves that follow each other: a real paradise. It's still an authentic area; here it's also possible to do birdwatching, and **dive into one of the most beautiful coral reefs in the world**.
